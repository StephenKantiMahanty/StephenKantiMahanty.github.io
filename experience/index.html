                            I am currently a student researcher at the Machine Learning and Autonomy for Diverse Domains (MADD) Lab at Harvey Mudd College. I work with integrating and optimizing Machine Learning models on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin platform for real-time computer vision applications for wildfire detections. My work includes implementing these models, benchmarking their performance, and optimizing them for low-latency inference. I also plan to dabble a little into drone communication networks and potentially Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) localization techniques.

                            Last Summer, I was a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) intern at the Colorado School of Mines in the Materials Science and Engineering division under Professor Anna Staerz. I worked with developing a Gallium Oxide Hydrogen sensor in harsh conditions. This project grew my skills in mechanical design, electrical setups, and Operando Spectroelectrochemistry (fancy way of saying "monitoring and analyzing spectroscopic device output in real-time").

                            My previous research includes working as a student researcher and project manager as part of the Degrees of Freedom Project (<a href="https://dofpro.org/" target="_blank" style="color: var(--circuit-green); text-decoration: underline;">DOFPro</a>) under Prof. Erik Spjut. I created and updated open-source educational software resources for HMC Engineering classes. I also built and test a 55m dual-deploy rocket that earned me NAR Level 1 Certification!

                            I am involved in two main academic clubs: <a href="https://www.muddsub.org/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: var(--circuit-green); text-decoration: underline;">MuddSub</a> and MACH.

                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.8;">
                            MuddSub is Harvey Mudd's student-run autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) team that competes in the international RoboSub competition. As the Electrical President, I lead students (see below) to work on the electrical systems of our AUV, Alfie, including designing and building custom PCBs, wiring the vehicle, and integrating various sensors and actuators. I also help with testing and debugging the vehicle to ensure it performs optimally during competitions.

                            MACH is Harvey Mudd's automotive club where we build a working automotive completely from scratch! As the Chief Powertrain Engineer, I oversee the design, development, and implementation of the vehicle's powertrain system, including the engine, transmission, and drivetrain. I work closely with other engineers in both mechanical and electrical systems to ensure that the powertrain is efficient, reliable, and meets performance goals.

                            I also do various non-academic clubs, such as the 5C Swim Club, 5CIV (Christian InterVarsity Group), and Drive HMC, our campus simulation racing club! I also serve as a South Dorm Mentor, helping frosh adjust and thrive to college life at HMC, and also hosting fun South Dorm events and traditions - including daily crosswords!

                            I currently work as a Teaching Assistant for the Engineering Design and Manufacturing (E4) Class at Harvey Mudd. I primarily help student teams with the design process and assist professors and the teaching team with questions and logistics to help the class. Teaching frosh in E4 has to be one of my most rewarding experiences so far!

                            In the past, I have worked as a tutor for Upward Bound, a company that helps low-income and first-generation high school students prepare for college. I tutored various subjects, including Math, Physics, and Chemistry, and helped students with college application essays and personal statements.

                        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.8;">
                            I also do private tutoring for students in various subjects across various ages! If you need help with any subject (including college applications), feel free to contact me! I may even give you a discount since you found me through my website ;)
